Biochar Star

Biochar Star is a webpage for a future business.  The webpage submitted in class is an educational webpage for biochar.  I will  transition it to a business webpage in the future that sells biochar and related items.   

CSS 

The colors chosen for website were primarily charcoal, black and gray which reflects colors of biochar.  Green was also used to reflect nature.  I kept the webite design simple because primary users will be envrionmental related people who prefer simplicity. I adjusted in css for mobile and desktop usage. I used responsive design for the navigation bar.  The navigation bar includes hidden text under hovered over. I also used responsive design for the contact page to include  Biochar Star email and address.    



Custom javaScript functions
 I created user forms.  I wanted to use a more advanced function than javacript to  check email validation so that it would be returned with either the positive validation message in green or not validated in red.  I used javasript to aid in responsive design.

Media queries:
Media queries were created to build the website mobile first. Media queries used to make website  naviagation menu responsive.   Media queries used to allow for responsive web design flexibility of form page.   

Accessibility:  I followed best practices to ensure that the website was accessible for those users with slower internet connections. The html, css , and javascript was loaded in that order in order to allow for faster accesss.   I  personally designed logo in paint so that it loads quickly and labeled it to meet accessibility rules.
