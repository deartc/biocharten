Biochar Star

Biochar Star is a future business webpage. Necause of time constrraints, the webpage submitted in class is an educational webpage for biochar.  I will  transition it to a business webpage in the future that sells biochar and related items.   


The colors chosen for website were primarily charcoal, black and gray which reflects colors of biochar.  Green was also used to reflect nature.  I kept the webite design simple because primary users will be envrionmental conscious people who prefer simplicity. I used responsive design for the navigation bar. I used color changes in the navigation bar  The navigation bar includes animation which involves displayed hidden text while  it is hovered over. I also used responsive design for the contact page to include  Biochar Star email and address.  Within css, I adjusted for mobile and desktop usage.  Media queries were created to build the website mobile first. Media queries used to make website  naviagation menu responsive.  I also used media queries  to allow for responsive web design flexibility of form page.  


 I created user forms.  I wanted to use a more advanced function than javacript to  check email validation so that it would be returned with either the positive validation message. I acheived one objective of changing colors on webpage.  I had it turn green if email was  validated. If not validated, it turned red.  I used javasript to aid in responsive design of the navigation bar.

 I followed best practices to ensure that the website was accessible for those users with slower internet connections. The html, css , and javascript was loaded in that order in order to allow for faster accesss.   I  personally designed the  logo  in  the software paint so that it loads quickly. I also  labeled it to meet accessibility rules.
